In typical 3D video games, limitations in VRAM dictate that large 3D scenes are loaded on demand, rather than reside in memory for the entire duration of the application. When a new scene is loaded, for example at the start of a new level, numerous assets compete for the bandwidth from storage to VRAM, and delays in the player experience are reduced by displaying and interacting with a partially loaded scene while the load is in progress. The result strongly depends on the order in which assets are loaded. In this work, we (1) demonstrate the drastic impact of the choice of the ordering of the assets; (2) propose a small number of heuristic strategies to automatically determine an ordering of assets, optimized for a given scene and spawning point; (3) present an agnostic, image-based tool to assess the efficacy of any given ordering of assets, that can be used to rank a-posteriori competing alternatives; (4) test our own tool on the ordering produced by our proposed heuristics, over a small set of test scenes taken from instances of real games. Our study suggests that the criteria to drive the order of asset loading should include the prediction of cast shadow and the size of the section of the screen occupied by each instance.
